This is an open source public API for Nigerian States and it was built using modern Javascript and Node.js. Developers can retrieve and utilize various data about each state of Nigeria like (but not limited to) Capital, Local GovernmentAreas, Geopolitical Zones etc. The API returns responses in the JSON format and does not require additional authentication. An SSR built to utilize this api is publicly accessible at https://regionify.onrender.com. The documentation is availabe at https://regionify.onrender.com/docs
You can contact me at https://t.me/coder9 for any suggestions on how this API can be improved or anything at all.
